We use pre-commit to run analysis and checks on the changes being committed. Take the following steps to ensure the pre-commit hook is installed and working:

1. Install git
    * Ensure the git `bin` directory has been added to %PATH%: `C:\Program Files\Git\bin`

1. Install Python
    * Ensure the python `bin` directory has been added to %PATH%

1. Install pre-commit
    * Open a terminal and navigate to the repository root directory
    * Install pre-commit with the following command: `pip install pre-commit`
    * Install pre-commit within the repository with the following command: `pre-commit install`
    * Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check pre-commit is working
